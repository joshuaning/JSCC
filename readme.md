# JSCC for Semantic Text Transmission: Comm with Built-in Translation

Semantic communication such as deep JSCC has been proven to work well in low SNR enviornment. 
Compared to traditional source coding and channel coding, JSCC does not suffer from the water
fall effect. However, in deep JSCC for text communication, the sentences recieved often suffer 
from semantic distortion, which result in the sentence recieved not exactly matching with the 
sentences transmitted.

In realistic communication senarios, most users want to receive exact text data transmitted. 
We decided to embrace this semantic distortion by utilizing deep JSCC for translation, since
semantic distortion is expected and tolerable in translation applications.

Our deep JSCC is modular, allowing fast re-training for switching languages and channel models.
This modularity can also be used for simultanous translation to multiple languages
